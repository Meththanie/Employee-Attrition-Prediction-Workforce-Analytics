# Employee Attrition Prediction & Workforce Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques and analyzing workforce-related factors that influence employee turnover. The goal is to support HR decision-making through data-driven insights.

This project was developed as part of a **group coursework** for the BSc (Hons) Data Science program.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Removed irrelevant columns

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Attrition trends by age, income, and job role
- Work-life balance and job satisfaction analysis
- Correlation analysis between numerical features

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

### Model Performance
- Best model: **Random Forest**
- Accuracy: **70.9%**
- ROC-AUC: **0.79**

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Employees with poor work-life balance show higher attrition
- Lower income and shorter tenure increase attrition risk
- Job satisfaction is a strong predictor of employee retention
